# THIS REPO MOVED!
Currently a more updated version of this project os bitbucket.<br>
At: https://bitbucket.org/dmz22136/yearsofshadow/src/main/

# YearsOfShadow
From scratch (including engine) survival horror voxel openworld sandbox game project.<br>
Utilizing very unconventional techniques to reach 10x to 1000x runtime of other competing games.<br>
With seemingly vastly smoother dev times for adding/maintaining mechanics.  Read Design.md for details.

## Building
Cmake + VS 2022 + Python 3.xx required for now.<br>
Make sure python is in path var, contact me if needing assistance.<br>
^ Optick is the reason for python dependency apologies for now will figure it out.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/redhatdragon/YearsOfShadow.git
cd YearsOfShadow
mkdir output
cd output
cmake ..
```
Open YearsOfShadow.sln and build

## If having issues building/testing
For now just join our discord community and ping me, I'll get back asap.
If you're new to building visual studio projects or coding in general also feel free to ping.

## NOTE
This repo will be maintained up till there's a vaguely playable multiplayer demo with some very basic mechanics.<br>
After which point there will be a shift to move the work over to a commerecial project.<br>
So think of this repo as more a proof of concept that anyone may take utility from in their own works.
